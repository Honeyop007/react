# React Element Renderer

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of rendering a React-like element using plain JavaScript. It aims to provide a clear understanding of how React's `createElement` and `render` functions work under the hood.

## Introduction

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. One of its core functionalities is the ability to create and render elements dynamically. This project mimics a simplified version of React's element creation and rendering process to help developers understand the underlying mechanics.

## Code Explanation

### Function: `renderElement`

The `renderElement` function takes two arguments: `root` and `element`.

```javascript
function renderElement(root, element) {
    const ele = document.createElement(element.type);

    ele.innerHTML = element.children;

    for (const prop in element.props) {
        ele.setAttribute(prop, element.props[prop]);
    }

    root.appendChild(ele);
}
```

- `root`: The root DOM element where the new element will be appended.
- `element`: An object representing the React-like element with `type`, `props`, and `children`.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Creates a new DOM element of the specified `type`.
2. Sets the inner HTML of the element to the provided `children`.
3. Iterates over the `props` and sets each attribute on the created element.
4. Appends the created element to the `root` element.

### React-like Element

The `reactElement` object simulates a React element with `type`, `props`, and `children`.

```javascript
const reactElement = {
    type: 'a',
    props: {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    children: 'click on me to visit Google'
};
```

- `type`: The type of the HTML element (e.g., `a` for anchor).
- `props`: An object containing the attributes and their values (e.g., `href` and `target`).
- `children`: The inner HTML content of the element.

### Root Element

The `root` element is selected from the DOM using `document.querySelector`.

```javascript
const root = document.querySelector('#root');
```

## How to Run

1. Create an HTML file and include the JavaScript code provided above.
2. Ensure you have an element with the ID `root` in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <div id="root"></div>
    ```

3. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic understanding of how React's element creation and rendering process works by simulating it with plain JavaScript. By breaking down the steps, developers can gain insights into the fundamental concepts behind React.
